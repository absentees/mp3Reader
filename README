TODO:
    1. Clean up Website MVC, redundant code.
    2. Add "Feed" MVC.
        Feed 'belongs' to User - User 'have one' feed.
        Websites 'belong to' multiple feeds. Feeds 'have many' websites.
    3. Make some pretty CSS style sheet.
    4. Add Nokogiri as HTML scraper - https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/wiki/
    5. Implement logic for scraping links from websites.
